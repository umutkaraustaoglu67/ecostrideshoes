                        <h2>Our Journey: How the Business Was Founded</h2>
                        <p>EcoStride was born out of a simple but powerful observation during a coastal cleanup in 2022. Our founders witnessed the devastating impact of plastic pollution on marine life and realized that the footwear industry was a major contributor to global waste.</p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">We decided to stop being part of the problem and start being part of the solution by transforming ocean trash into high-performance gear.</p>

                        <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">The business was established by <strong>Alex Rivers</strong> and <strong>Jordan Green</strong>. Alex brings over 10 years of experience in sustainable materials research, while Jordan specializes in ergonomic athletic design.</p>

                        <h2>What We Sell</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">At EcoStride, we specialize in eco-friendly sneakers designed for performance and style. Our products are crafted from <strong>100% recycled ocean plastics</strong>, reclaimed rubber, and organic cotton.</p>

                        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
